# Build A Business Mock Website!

For your first project, you're going to build a responsive mock business website using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. You'll pick one of a few provided designs or one of your own choosing and build an honest replica
of it.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Fulfill the listed requirements below.
3. Create an index.html, styles.css, script.js file.


## Task
The goal is to build an accurate clone of your chosen site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Do your best to get everything looking as similar as possible. Use all the available resources you've been given - documentation, your peers, and your instructors. Additionally, your site should be responsive (meaning it looks good on mobile,
tablet, and desktop).

#### Part 1: Choose a Site
Pick a website from the list provided below. If you would like to build a mock of a site of your choosing, it will need to be approved by your instructor. **Please note, that you are to recreate the entire site, not just copy the screenshot as it is on a reference.**

#### Part 2: Responsiveness
Use media queries to rearrange content so that it looks good on different devices. If your mock only has designs for desktop, then it's up to you to figure out how to make it look good on mobile. It's really common in the industry for designers to come up with the desktop designs and then have the developers figure out the best way to present it on mobile and tablet.

#### Part 3: Deployment
Finally, you should deploy your website to [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This is a free hosting service provided by GitHub for deploying static websites (no server or database). This is the part of the project that you get to figure out on your own! 

##### Summary of requirements
In sum, the requirements for this project are:
* Pick a mock from list provided above, if you choose a site outside of the list you must get it approved by instructor. 
* Implement HTML & CSS to match the structure and aesthetic of site.
* Utilize JavaScript to match interactivity of site.
* Make your mock responsive using media queries.
* Deploy your website to GitHub Pages.

### Helpful Suggestions

Don't spend too much time getting the images exactly right. If you need to, pick a placeholder stock image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

Work on the structure first. Don't get stuck with details until you've got most of the high level stuff done.

Try to find the exact font on Google, if you can. Don't pay for a font! Instead, use Google fonts and try to find a font that is close to the one in the design!
